Apex triggers.


Trigger Syntax. 

trigger TriggerName on ObjectName (trigger_events) {

code_block
}

To execute a trigger before or after insert, update, delete, and undelete operations, specify multiple trigger events in a comma-separated list. The events you can specify are:
before insert
before update
before delete
after insert
after update
after delete
after undelete


Before triggers are used to update or validate record values before theyâ€™re saved to the database.
After triggers are used to access field values that are set by the system (such as a record's Id or LastModifiedDate field), 
and to affect changes in other records. The records that fire the after trigger are read-only.




LeadProcessor myLeads = new LeadProcessor();
Id batchId = Database.executeBatch(myLeads);
